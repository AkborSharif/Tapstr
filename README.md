# Tapstr
Tapstr is a single-row reduced Qwerty that enables text
entry by taps and directional strokes. It is a nonambiguous
keyboard, thus does not rely on a statistical decoder. It
supports the entry of uppercase and lowercase letters, numeric
characters, special symbols, and emojis. Its purpose
is to free up touchscreen real-estate and potentially enable
text entry on smaller devices, such as smartwatches. In a
user study, Tapstr yielded 11 WPM with plain phrases and
8 WPM with mixed phrases containing uppercase letters,
numbers, and special symbols.
